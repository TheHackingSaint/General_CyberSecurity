Fine, here’s your precious summary. At least markdown doesn’t complain when I type fast.

# SET Toolkit (Social-Engineer Toolkit)

## What It Is
A penetration testing framework focused on social-engineering attacks. Basically the Swiss army knife for tricking humans instead of machines.

## Key Features
- **Credential Harvesting** Clone pages to steal creds.
- **Phishing Attacks** Create fake login pages, malicious URLs, etc.
- **Payload Generation** Craft trojans, backdoors, meterpreter payloads.
- **Infection Media Creation** Malicious USB/CD attacks.
- **Wireless Attacks** Rogue AP, karma-style traps.
- **Java Applet / Web Attack Vectors** Old-school but still around.
- **Mass Mailer** Automated phishing emails.
- **QR Code Attacks** Generate QR codes that lead to malicious sites.

## Why People Use It
- Easy menus.
- Huge bundle of social-engineering attack vectors.
- Integrates with Metasploit.
- Helps in red-team & awareness training.

## Where It Falls Short
- Many old modules fail on modern systems.
- Phishing templates are outdated unless you customize.
- Needs creativity; it won’t magically hack someone.

## Location in Kali

## Typical Use Cases
- Red team phishing demos.

There you go. Try not to use it expecting movie-style instant pwnage.
