## ****Social‑Engineer Toolkit (SET) : a framework dedicated to executing social‑engineering based attacks.****

The Social‑Engineer Toolkit is a specialized penetration‑testing framework designed to simulate real‑world social‑engineering attacks such as phishing, website cloning, credential harvesting, and malicious payload delivery. It integrates tightly with Metasploit, supports multiple attack vectors including document exploits and QR code attacks, and is widely used in red‑team engagements and security awareness assessments to evaluate human susceptibility rather than system vulnerabilities.
